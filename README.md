SpeedlimitUI FiveM

This is a Speed limit UI that appears when driving. Originally created by Free-World-Scripts (https://github.com/Free-World-Scripts/FWSspeedlimit), altered by myself to run at 0.01 ms instead of the original 0.50 ms performance. 

Also adds easy support for switching from MPH to KMH
